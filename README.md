# Python_API_WeatherPy

I noticed that I forgot to include (%) and (mph) in my charts but I was honestly a bit nervous to re-run my code in order to update 
the charts because I had already struggled with the max limit on my api key and had to get a new one.  So, please note that it is 
in the code to have my charts labeled properly but it is not in the charts that are displayed.
